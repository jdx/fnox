## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize fnox in your project
fnox init

# Set a secret (stores it encrypted in fnox.toml)
fnox set DATABASE_URL "postgresql://localhost/mydb"

# Get a secret
fnox get DATABASE_URL

# Run commands with secrets loaded as env vars
fnox exec -- npm start

# Enable shell integration (auto-load secrets on cd)
eval "$(fnox activate bash)"  # or zsh, fish
```

## How It Works

fnox uses a simple TOML config file (`fnox.toml`) that you check into git. Secrets are either:

1. **Encrypted inline** - The encrypted ciphertext lives in the config file
2. **Remote references** - The config contains a reference (like "my-db-password") that points to a secret in AWS/1Password/etc.

You configure providers (encryption methods or cloud services), then assign each secret to a provider. fnox handles the rest.

```toml
# fnox.toml
[providers.age]
type = "age"
recipients = ["age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p"]

[secrets.DATABASE_URL]
provider = "age"
value = "YWdlLWVuY3J5cHRpb24uLi4="  # ← encrypted ciphertext, safe to commit

[secrets.API_KEY]
default = "dev-key-12345"  # ← plain default value for local dev
```

## Supported Providers

- **age** - Modern encryption (works with SSH keys!)
- **aws-kms** - AWS Key Management Service
- **azure-kms** - Azure Key Vault encryption
- **gcp-kms** - Google Cloud KMS

### ☁️ Cloud Secret Storage (remote, centralized)

- **aws-sm** - AWS Secrets Manager
- **azure-sm** - Azure Key Vault Secrets
- **gcp-sm** - Google Cloud Secret Manager
- **vault** - HashiCorp Vault

### 🔑 Password Managers

- **1password** - 1Password CLI
- **bitwarden** - Bitwarden/Vaultwarden

### 💻 Local Storage

- **keychain** - OS Keychain (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- **plain** - Plain text (for defaults only!)
