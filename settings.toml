# Fnox Settings Registry
#
# This file defines all configurable settings for fnox, including:
# - Type information
# - Default values
# - Configuration sources (CLI flags, environment variables, config files)
# - Documentation
#
# The build script (build/generate_settings.rs) reads this file and generates:
# - src/generated/settings.rs - Settings struct with type-safe fields
# - src/generated/settings_merge.rs - Merge logic and types
# - src/generated/settings_meta.rs - Metadata for introspection

Control output level for shell integration.

Available modes:
- "none" - No output from shell integration
- "normal" - Show summary when secrets are loaded/unloaded (default)
- "debug" - Show detailed information including early-exit reasons

When set to "normal", fnox will output a summary to stderr showing which
secrets were loaded or unloaded, with truncated values (first 8 characters).

When set to "debug", fnox will additionally show:
- When hook-env runs
- Whether it exits early (optimization)
- Why it exits early (no changes detected)
- Config file paths being loaded

This is useful for understanding what the shell integration is doing and
troubleshooting issues.
